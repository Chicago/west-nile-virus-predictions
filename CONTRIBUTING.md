## Reporting an Issue

Chicago's West Nile Virus project uses [GitHub Issue Tracking](https://github.com/Chicago/west-nile-virus-predictions/issues) to track issues. This is a good place to start and can be a helpful place to manage both technical and non-technical issues. 

## Submitting Code Changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to City of Chicago](https://github.com/chicago/west-nile-virus-predictions/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). Always write a clear log message for your commits. 

### Ability to adopt model
